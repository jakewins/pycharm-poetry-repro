- Open this whole repo in pycharm
- Open the "myapp" subdirectory and "attach" it
- Open the "mylib" subdirectory and "attach" it
- Configure myapp and mylib to each have their own poetry python interpreter
- Shake it all around a bit, wait for things to resolve


Outcome:

- Project now works, I can run "app.py" inside pycharm, and it prints the message from the library
- However, the import is not resolved in the editor

Expected outcome:

- The editor to resolve the import of mylib in app.py
